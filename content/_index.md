DRAFT

Get some info from Metanoia about the importance of metanoia...

Jesus, the Supreme Agent of God, announces God's intentions for mankind. Those intentions are summarized for us by the gospel writers' description of Jesus' command to "Repent." But that's not an accurate translation of what Jesus actually said - "metanoite" (pronounced meta-no-EH-oh).

It literally means, "Change your mind."

If God's intention is for every human being to change their minds, then the greatest attribute we could possibly possess is a changeable mind.

That's why I chose to call this website, "Changeable Minds."

Here's how the website works.
Posts represent bits of data I'm transferring from all of the index cards, post-it notes, and digital files I've collected over years of research.

Gladwell has a huge pile of stuff covering his desk. He has reams of printout with hours and hours of transcribed interviews. He has coffee stained Moleskin notebooks packed with his chicken scrawl from the scores of research papers and books he’s read. He’s got post-it notes, backs of envelopes, tear sheets, and scraps of newspaper…all with some intellectual fragment that he’ll need to assemble his first draft.

Posts may be random thoughts...

Unconnected to other bits...

But what should be done with all those bits? I need a means of structuring the data into content that can be communicated. So, I've decided to write a book. Not because I feel I'm capable of it. I have no idea how to do it.

Although challenging, I want to go through the process as a means of making decisions about the content...

Books are proven means of effectively communicating...



As I make connections between those bits of data, I will assemble the information into Pages.

Here is a very basic outline for the argument I will be presenting:

- We are failing. (Modern western church IS not making - and CANNOT make - disciples in its current state.)
  - Failure results when results don't meet expectations.
  - To prove our failure, we need to compare Jesus' expectations (make disciples) against our results (average believer).
- What Jesus expected. (What is this thing for?)
  - Define "disciple"
  - "of Jesus" (Who was he? What did he come to do?)
    - change your mind
- What we're producing.
  - Barna stats
- Possible causes for our failure.
  - Spoiler alert: we're the problem.
  - The very beliefs and practices we cling to as part of our identity are the very things causing our failure.
- Our current (failing) process.
  - How did we acquire this process?
    - Ellul - "Subversion of Christianity"
  - Is it sacred? (No.)
  - Can we change it?
- Early church process. (How is it supposed to do that?)

- Confirmation biases.
- Belief acquisition and change.


Humans love stories.
About change.
Protagonist - one who changes.
We are captivated by watching protagonist change.
What if you were the one who needed to change?
How would you react?

Your current "reality" is an illusion.
Things are not as they seem.
This is a world at war.
You have a crucial role to play.
What would it take to convince you?

This is the question that has prompted me to study the Bible for the last twenty years. It's why I created this website.
